Enterprise IT organizations are under business\npressure to open up their networks to Internet applications, while struggling to keep Internet-\nconnected endpoints free from malware. SWGs provide filtering and control over the Internet\nwhile enabling the broader use of beneficial interactive Web applications. As a result, security\nhas eclipsed employee productivity monitoring (i.e., URL filtering) as a primary motivator of\nbuyers in this market. SWG buyers are typically \u201cType A\u201d security-conscious organizations in\nindustries such as finance, government agencies, defense, high-tech and pharmaceuticals.\nHowever, we are starting to see more broad-based horizontal distribution of organizations\nlooking at SWGs to improve their endpoint security posture. Typically, these mainstream\nadopters have been infected by malware, and an SWG represents the fastest and often least-\nexpensive means to improve endpoint security to thwart future infections.\nInnovation and feature development are still being driven by smaller, dedicated SWG\ncompanies; the traditional incumbent URL-filtering, antivirus and proxy cache vendors are\nstill playing catch-up. Despite rapid feature development, we still find it difficult in this market\nto select vendors that satisfy buyers in all product features.
